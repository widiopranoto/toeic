He got the idea to sell tents to the gold miners, but they were not interested. He recycled the brown canvas cloth into sturdy pants which became a great demand in mining camps. Later he began making workpants in a blue cotton fabric imported from France, called ‘Serge de Nimes’, but known in America as ‘Denim’.<br>Along with Jacob Davis, a tailor from Nevada, Strauss patented a pattern of copper rivets to strengthen the stress point on pants, especially pocket. They first became known as waist overalls, then ‘Levis’. They became so popular that Strauss concentrated most of his effort on the manufacture and sales of the durable work pants.",
